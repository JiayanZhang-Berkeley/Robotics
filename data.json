One billion people live less than 10 meters above rising oceans, 1 in 6 people live in areas with significant wildfire risk, 43% of critical infrastructure is in disrepair and will cost $2.6T to fix, and pollution from the Manhattan Project is still being cleaned up with a $300B invoice, food production must increase 60% to feed 2050 population, it will take 757 years to remove mines in Ukraine with traditional methods. What do these problems have in common? One, our civilization does not have a feasible way to address challenges of this magnitude. Two, earthmoving is a key part of the solution. Our commercially deployed autonomy product runs a wide range of existing earthmoving machinery (new, older, large, small, any brand). As a result, our customers run their operations at maximum throughput and safety. The AIM platform unlocks tremendous value across mining, construction, and defense. AIM has been built by world-class engineers who developed cutting-edge products Google, Waymo, Tesla & SpaceX. We bring deep expertise in autonomy, robotics, hardware, and advanced AI deployed at scale.",

It develops AI-powered drones to deliver the power and flying cameras without the complexity. The company's drones use an array of cameras and proprietary computer vision technology to recognize, avoid objects in real-time, and predict into the future to make intelligent decisions, enabling users by flying themselves through the most demanding tasks or keeping them safe from obstacles when they want to take control. The company's debut drone, the R1, could track a target and film them while avoiding obstacles without any human intervention required. Then the company released the Skydio 2 in 2019, its second drone, cutting off more than half the price while improving it its autonomous tracking and video capabilities. Its flagship product, the X2, is equipped with seven cameras, 100x zoom, night vision, and promises to turn ordinary users into expert pilots thanks to its self-piloting abilities. It is backed by top investors and strategic partners including Andreessen Horowitz, Linse Capital, Next47, IVP, Playground, NVIDIA, and UP.Partners.",

      "Asteroid mining has lived at the intersection of scientific research and popular culture for decades, with as many academic papers published as there are books, TV shows and movies about it. Access to resources, with its finite nature and disparate distribution of resources, plays an essential part in the geopolitical web of power and wealth. It has defined economic growth to such an extent that we have been using them as primary demarcation lines and identifiers in our history, from the stone to bronze and iron age to our current silicon age. But our resources-driven growth faces a massive existential challenge, with climate change, ecosystem degradation and resource depletion demanding a complete reset. Humanity needs to shift global transportation, manufacturing, construction and energy onto a sustainable path. Expanding beyond the K\u00e1rm\u00e1n line is where we believe transformative future growth and innovation will be found. Recent missions by NASA (OSIRIS-REx & DART) and JAXA (Hayabusa2) have firmly pushed the idea of using space resources from academic research into commercial opportunity. We believe the Regolith Age, powered by abundant space resources, is an inevitability that we can accelerate.",

      "SlipBots auto-load/unload any truck in 5 minutes -- so truckers don't wait, and forklift drivers don't risk it. Truck drivers spend 23% of their workday just idling at a dock and waiting for forklift drivers to load/unload their trailer, while forklift drivers face constant pressure to load/unload freight faster despite all the risks of damage and injury. Now, those same people can solve this bottleneck with the click of a button: commanding SlipBots to fully auto-load/unload a trailer in under 5 minutes minutes, instead of rushing to drive forklifts in & out of a trailer for 30+ minutes. Slip Robotics empowers people to auto-load & unload any truck in 5 minutes using SlipBot Automated Loading Robots (ALRs) -- at any dock, in any trailer, and with zero Wi-Fi or IT integration required. The SlipBot robots-as-a-service network drives 10x improvements in safety, speed, and savings across the supply chain.",

The robotic platform enables: 1. robotic solar panel laying 2. robotic materials movement (pallets of panels, i-beams, torque tubes, etc.) 3. robotic solar vegetation management (grass & vegetation cutting) The Economist magazine predicts solar will become the world's #1 electricity source by the 2030's and #1 overall energy source by the 2040's. Solar is the only energy source that can get electrons on the grid in 18 months to meet growing electricity demand for data centers & AI. The biggest bottleneck is labor, which Swap solves. Solar panel laying is the biggest labour expense during EPC (construction) phase. Cutting the grass is the biggest expense during O&M (Ops & Maintenance) phase, & remains for decades. $15 million USD raised to-date as of June 2025.",

In addition, for conventional farmers, it can also microspray and reduce the use of plant protection substances up to 94%. The unique precision at seeding makes it possible to clean the crop up close and thereby minimize, or completely eliminate, the need for manual weed control. The four solar panels on top of the robot produce power for a battery package and ensure up to 24 hours daily CO2-neutral operation. Thereby, you avoid external charging of the batteries and you can let your FarmDroid FD20 work in the field throughout the entire season.",

      "Adapta Robotics addresses diverse automation scenarios & problems in environments where automation is challenging to be brought & their use cases not addressed by common, existing solutions. The product lines are built on AI solutions & technologies, which come on top of the robots\u2019 core functionalities. Adapta\u2019s portfolio contains two product lines (MATT-the device testing robot- & ERIS-the effective retail intelligent scanner), offering the undeniable advantage of adaptable & easy-to-integrate automation when people & software solutions are inefficient/ insufficient. Both lines incorporate robotics as well as AI & computer vision while adding value through the team\u2019s custom robotics development services. MATT, the smart device testing robot, covers the automation of scenarios throughout the device testing process (touch screens & buttons, but not only) that humans & software solutions can\u2019t solve or handle. MATT solves the need for continuous device testing, enhancing testing automation through physical interaction with devices. It helps manufacturers, developers or solution providers to keep up with the increasing complexity of gadgets, apps, functionalities & updates. MATT & its software ecosystem was designed to be easily scalable & upgraded. Its features make it an ideal solution for testing anywhere from R&D to performance verification, connectivity & end of line testing. By using AI, MATT can perform context awareness and dynamic reactions to events (popups), differentiating &navigating on a UI based on visual cues, or even implementing typical usage scenarios, following user interaction. For MATT, the device testing use cases it performs are as diverse as the industries it is utilized by (automotive, aerospace, medical, R&D, device refurbishment, consumer electronics, smart home appliances). We have built MATT\u2019s capabilities on AI & computer vision; hence the device-testing robot is able to cover a wide range of scenarios: speech & image recognition, icon recognition, OCR, QR & many more. Its abilities are also extending to use cases in industrial environments such as color-coding recognition for picking up products- using suction cups- and storing them in warehouses according to associated color codes; or automatizing the recycling process of tiers scraps by selecting the ones that where color coded to have the adequate chemical composition. ERIS- effective retail intelligent scanning- contributes to the retailer's digitalization by utilizing AI solutions to combat the biggest challenges & support the implementation of automation. ERIS uses AI to solve price & promotion discrepancies (from shelf to cash register) & minimize customer dissatisfaction caused by empty shelves & price tag mistakes. This is achieved by checking the correctness of prices on the shelf, detecting in-store out-of-stock situations, real-time operation, construction of visual maps & panoramic previews, easy-to-use interface & controls (accessible & adaptable: 4g internet connection, light intensity control, computing operator travel speed). The technology behind ERIS is based on AI at the edge, having the capabilities of- including, but not only- price label detection, and product stock detection. The technology behind the robot, the hardware vision modules inside it, the computer vision models & AI algorithms that track stock modifications, price discrepancies, and product placement, can be repurposed to other applications for a wider variety of setups and scenarios related to the retail space. These include fixed camera systems that can track stock changes, automatic hand-held scanners for stores with reduced footprints, and autonomous solutions for tracking inventory and its placement in warehouses for the logistics space. These directions are approachable through the technology that has already been implemented. Underlining our capabilities are the three pillars of Adapta: MATT, ERIS, and custom robotics services. These pillars leverage our in-house developed and real-life validated technologies to construct project-specific solutions tailored to the unique requirements and needs of each use case (e.g. development of AI modules, custom electronics, custom robotics etc.). AI and custom robotics allow interaction with different environments, cases, and domains, by utilizing, for example, MATT\u2019s technology to offer testing services for HMIs and devices with touchscreens and/or buttons. Apart from the industries where MATT and ERIS activate in, custom robotics allows the team to interact with different cases and domains: in real estate tech & IoT custom developed smart hotel & smart office solutions; developing health monitoring bracelets dedicated to elders\u2019 assistance. This diversity of environments allowed us to also work on scenarios requiring NFC & RFID.",

      "Skygauge Robotics has reinvented the drone to perform a wider range of industrial work. Their first application is taking metal thickness checks on industrial structures, bridges, ships, and wind turbines. Instead of having workers on ropes, boom lifts, and scaffolding The Skygauge will perform thickness checks 5-20x faster. This reduces downtime, cost of inspection, and increases safety by keeping workers on the ground. Once they capture the inspection market, their technology will branch out into pressure washing/cleaning, painting/coating, maintenance, and construction. The same way robot arms created a workforce in factories their drones will create a workforce in the sky.",

We believe that by training end to end controls in simulation with reinforcement learning and above that iterating hardware designs, we can automate the whole development process. To validate our approaches for our AI system and to collect data, we invented an automatic tile grouting robot that boosts productivity by up to 5x. We have started sales of the grouting robot in Singapore and have industry demos in Hong Kong and USA and leads in Japan, Korea, Europe, and UAE. Our clients in Singapore include Woh Hup and BHCC. Tile grouting is the process of filling up the gaps between tiles after the tiles have been laid. We invented a patented robot that is able to automatically grout and clean tile gaps with only a press of a button. We\u2019ve raised over 3m USD from Hoxton Ventures, Credo Ventures, our Professor from Cambridge University, Woh Hup, ffVC, and the owner of BHCC (listed construction company). We\u2019ve 2500sqft of space in Singapore where we have over 20 team members, and 1200sqft of space in Czechia where we have our software team.",

      "The world has realized the negative environmental impact of methane emissions and is now embracing the need to identify and mitigate them. Sniffer Robotics has developed an advanced solution helpful in accomplishing this objective. The solution, referred to as the SnifferDRONE\u2122, is an unmanned aerial system (UAS) featuring a drone integrated with Sniffer developed and patented technology.  The SnifferDRONE collects a corpus of methane concentration (PPM) data at the ground surface, with location coordinates, in an efficient and effective manner. The information that results provides accurate and comprehensive methane leak locations and emission quantification. Though the SnifferDRONE was initially developed for the municipal solid waste (MSW) landfill market (the third-largest source of human-related methane emissions in the US according to the EPA), it is also applicable for other land-based applications found in the renewable natural gas, mining, and other markets. Because of the SnifferDRONE\u2019s ability to locate more leak locations, MSW sites are also successfully using the system to aid in the reduction of landfill odors. Sniffer is a \u201cTechnology as a Service\u201d company utilizing advanced technologies and solutions to collect, analyze, and inform for action. The company offers a wide range of aerial (drone-based) services, field services, and is a provider and developer of Esri GIS mapping and spatial analytical software solutions. We endeavor to deliver clear and concise information through advanced tools and solutions, that engages and excites our clients to act.",

This is the first ever clinically proven option to effectively treat foot drop. Their robot is easy to use and designed to be run by lower skilled clinic staff freeing up therapists to focus on more hands modalities. As they collect more data, the software will transition into an AI-based system to assess and assigns training protocols optimized for each patient\u2019s deficit. The improved outcomes will allow clinics to provide reimbursable therapy using existing CPT codes for gait training on a patient base they currently have no treatment for. The device will be registered with the FDA as a Class 1 Exercise Device; and so, it can be sold and used WITHOUT FDA APPROVAL.

      "AlterEcho develops remote embodiment robotics enabling life science professionals to perform aseptic work from outside cleanrooms or hazardous zones. Using VR headsets and motion controllers, operators control robot arms in sealed chambers with full dexterity and 3D vision - safely distant from contamination and biohazards. Unlike laboratory hoods, glove boxes and isolators exposing humans and limiting throughput, AlterEcho eliminates human presence in critical processes, achieving true Class A (EU-GMP Annex 1) sterility while maintaining flexibility for complex tasks. Our platform integrates robotics with AI assistance, supporting delicate procedures with complete control and traceability. For laboratory hoods, AlterEcho offers plug-and-play upgrades to remote operation. In pharmaceutical manufacturing, we replace glove-based isolators with robotics chambers keeping staff outside sterile zones. Our vision: compact robotics containers piloted by skilled professionals and enhanced by adaptive AI. This defines life sciences' future: relying on human mind, not body. Physically demanding tasks become precision robot piloting - eliminating fatigue and injury, making roles accessible to a more diverse workforce as markets evolve. AlterEcho serves pharmaceutical manufacturers in aseptic processing including injectables and Class A cleanroom workflows. Our technology benefits specialty labs in radiopharma, infectious disease, and vaccine R&D where biohazard handling is critical. In clinical settings, our system enables remote sterile compounding and ATMP handling, even during outbreaks or staffing shortages. AlterEcho delivers zero contamination risk, fewer rejected batches, smaller space requirements, staffing flexibility, and a path to intelligent autonomisation. We transform cleanrooms from bottlenecks into remotely operated, AI-enhanced environments for these critical industries.",

This poses challenges in bookkeeping, scaling operations, managing quality and production defects and efficiency, and high management time / presence in ops to ensure people aspects (labor unions, transparency, etc). Low cost autonomous systems at a fraction of a supervisor's expense, installed at key points of operations, can provide 24x7 supervision, assistance and digitization of operations. Usecases: Address skill shortage with real-time training and operations assistance. Factory monitoring for worker productivity and HR compliance. Operational measurement, compliance & SSOT with SOP Digitization for production & quality management. Operational efficiency analysis and improvements for achieving higher scale Goal: Enable Digital Factories that provide highly automated visibility with minimal involvement from Management, so it can focus on scaling business while ensuring compliance, while being able to operate remotely.",

Robots and computer vision systems are slowly making their way out of the factory and into less structured environments such as hospitals, warehouses, farms, and homes. Although recent advances are quite impressive, these systems are still limited in their ability to understand what they see and must be carefully programmed to get the bare minimum of information out of their sensory data in order to accomplish their assigned tasks. Their goal at CapSen Robotics is to change this\u2014they have developed a suite of computer vision solutions based on new research from MIT on 3D object detection in cluttered scenes. This is a foundational technology that will have broad impact on a wide range of consumer, industrial, and defense markets, from computer gaming and augmented reality to logistics, manufacturing, and robotics. They are beta testing with system integrators like The Proud Company and robotics companies like IAM Robotics on robotic picking applications, and are partnering with a top 5 government contractor on a non-robotic warehouse application for a large Fortune 100 distributor.

      "We are a bootstrap tech startup. We were founded by a group of dedicated aviation engineers in 2006. After developing and selling more than 100 ultralight sports aircraft, the company developed a high-performance unmanned aerial system, Raybird 3. Raybird 3 is a fully autonomous airborne robot system. Independent journalists adjudicated our flight endurance at 24.5 hours with a carburetor engine. Recently, we adopted fuel injection that extends our flight endurance beyond 30 hours, uninterrupted/day & night. Our LTM revenue as of May 2020 was $3.3M, and we are profitable. We developed 80% of our 48 subsystems, which gives us agility and flexibility to provide tailored turnkey solutions to our customers' needs reliably. https://fire-in.eu/en listed our solution as civilian use for early wildfire detection. We already held meetings with France, Spain, & Greece and gained tractions with the US Dept. of Interiors. We just don't sell systems; we also provide Drone(Data)-as-a-Service business model to enterprises who may have limited use of our system on a yearly basis. We owned several patents, of which one of them approved in May 2020 by US PTO. We have several unique custom solutions built on AI/Computer Vision. One of them is to work in tandem with First Responders in early wildfire detections. We can scan 10,000 sq. Km every 12 hours. The moment the drone detects a hotspot as small as 6x3 feet from 2,700 feet above the ground, it goes back to the location to take pictures. Images then is transmitted to the Ground Control Station so the Operator can dispatch the First Responder to the site. We also provide Geodesy certified mapping of large areas. We are a UAV swarm minded company and have many exciting projects in the pipeline that will continue to shatter new grounds. We are disrupting terrestrial & piloted flying systems, data collection, detection, and mapping businesses.",

      "Flexibility and autonomy are core requirements for the factory of the future. In the field of intralogistics, AMRs are the key to meeting these requirements. However, the current patchwork of incompatible and inadequate SW solutions for AMRs on the market prevents the spread of this key technology and puts fleet operators further into vendor lock-in situations. With NODE.OS, we provide an end-to-end software solution for operating multi-vendor and heterogeneous AMR fleets with high autonomy and minimal commissioning efforts which can be seamlessly integrated into every production plant.",
